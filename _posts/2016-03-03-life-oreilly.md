Welcome to our site showing our Freedom 40, centre cockpit, cat rigged ketch - Life O'Reilly.

Built in 1988, she is currently situated in Algarve, Portugal. She has just undergone a refit and is ready to sail. She has stainless wishbone booms and wrap around sails, sleeps 8 in 3 cabins with the masters cabin in the stern.

We will be adding more photos and details in the coming days. 

She is the ideal cruising boat, as the rig is super easy to reef (you don't need to alter course to do so even when short handed (or single handed).

She is especially suited to warmer climates with a huge cockpit that seats 12 people.
